1.1 Background
*******************

The devastation of the 2013 Southern Alberta and Toronto Floods triggered a transition in Canada from the traditional standards-based approach, where flood protection is designed for a single level-of-safety, towards a risk-based approach. This new risk-based approach recognizes that robust planning must consider vulnerability and the full range of floods that may harm a community rather than focus on a single, arbitrary, design event. Further, a risk-based view allows decision makers to quantitatively optimize mitigations for their community, helping jurisdictions with shrinking budgets spread protections further. The foundation of decisions made under a risk-based flood management is a risk assessment, which is:

   *A methodology to determine the risk by analyzing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend (UNISDR 2009).*

To quantify risk, modern risk assessments integrate data on the natural and built environment with predictive models. Applied in flood risk management, a risk analysis is highly sensitive to the spatial components of risk: vulnerability (what has been built where and how harmful are flood waters?) and hazard (where and how intense can flooding be?). Evaluating these components is typically accomplished with a chain of activities like data collection, processing, modelling, and post-processing to arrive at the desired risk metrics. The core components of a typical flood risk assessment are the hazard assessment to synthesize spatial exposure-likelihood data sets and a damage assessment to estimate damage to assets from the hazard assessment results, followed by the risk quantification that uses event probabilities to estimate average damages.
